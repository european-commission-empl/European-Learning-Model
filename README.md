# Europass Learning Model
Data Model for Interoperability of Learning Opportunities, Qualifications and Credentials in Europe. This data model is in use by:


The European Commission is developing the Europass Digital Credentials Infrastructure (EDCI) – a set of tools, services and software to support the issuance of authentic, tamper-proof digital credentials (such as qualifications and other learning achievements) across Europe. The EDCI is being developed as part of ongoing work to implement the new Europass Framework for supporting transparency of skills and qualifications in Europe.

As part of this work, the Commission has developed a draft data model for a learning credential. 

The [Europass Learning Model](https://github.com/european-commission-europass/Europass-Learning-Model/blob/master/Europass_Learning_Model.md) aims to capture the results of any non-formal and formal learning across Europe, as well as the validation of non-formal and informal learning. It is designed to provide a single format to describe certificates of attendance, examination results, degrees and diplomas, diploma supplements, professional certifications, employer recommendations and any other kind of claims that are related to learning.

## Alignment with Other Standards
The Europass Learning Model is an extension of the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model) expressed as XML/XSD, for the purposes of providing a standardised format of describing learning within the European Union and European Economic Area.

The Data model is also aligned with the [ELMO/EMREX Standard](https://github.com/emrex-eu/elmo-schemas)

## Contents
The current version of the data model provides description of concepts including:
* definition of the Europass extension of a Europass Verifiable Credential
* definition of the Europass extension of a Europass Verifiable Presentation
* definition of a Europass learning opportunity
