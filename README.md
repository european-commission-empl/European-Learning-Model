The European Learning Model (ELM) is a Data Model for Interoperability of Learning Opportunities, Qualifications, Accreditation and Credentials in Europe, developed by the European Commission.

The [European Learning Model](https://github.com/european-commission-empl/European-Learning-Model/blob/master/Europass_Learning_Model.md) aims to capture the results of any non-formal and formal learning across Europe, as well as the validation of non-formal and informal learning. It is designed to provide a single format to describe certificates of attendance, examination results, degrees and diplomas, diploma supplements, professional certifications, employer recommendations and any other kind of claims that are related to learning.

This data model is in use by the European Digital Credentials Infrastructure (EDCI) and the Qualifications Dataset Register (QDR). The EDCI is a set of tools, services and software to support the issuance of authentic, tamper-evident digital credentials (such as qualifications and other learning achievements) across Europe. The EDCI has been developed as part of an ongoing work to implement the new Europass Framework for supporting transparency and verifiability of citizens’ skills and qualifications in Europe. The QDR is a register for publishing qualifications and learning opportunities in order to have these searchable on the Europass platform. 

**Navigating the folders**

**RDF Folder:** In the RDF folder you will find the RDF files, the JSON LD context where applicable as well as a documentation folder with HTML documentation for each application profile. 

**XSD Folder**: This folder contains the verification profiles intended to be used for the QDR, one for accreditations and one for learning opportunities and qualifications (LOQ). 

**Ontology folder:** This folder contains the full ontology of the ELM.

## Alignment with Other Standards

The European Learning Model is an extension of the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model) expressed as JSON-LD, for the purposes of providing a standardised technical format of any learning described within the European Union and European Economic Area.

The Data model is also aligned with, and fully mapped to, the [ELMO/EMREX Standard](https://github.com/emrex-eu/elmo-schemas)

## Contents

The current version of the data model provides description of concepts including:
•	European Digital Credential (that is a Verifiable Credential)
•	Learning Opportunities and Qualifications
•	Accreditation
•	Person Identity


## Further Information
Additional documentation, explanations and walkthroughs are available from our [Interoperability Pages](https://europa.eu/europass/en/stakeholders/european-digital-credentials).
