# EDCI-Data-Model
Data Model for the Europass Digital Credentials Infrastructure

The European Commission is developing the Europass Digital Credentials Infrastructure (EDCI) – a set of tools, services and software to support the issuance of authentic, tamper-proof digital credentials (such as qualifications and other learning achievements) across Europe. The EDCI is being developed as part of ongoing work to implement the new Europass Framework for supporting transparency of skills and qualifications in Europe.

As part of this work, the Commission has developed a draft data model for a learning credential. The draft data model is now available for consultation and will be open for consultation until the end of 2019.

The following data model aims to capture the results of any non-formal and formal learning across Europe, as well as the validation of non-formal and informal learning. It is designed to provide a single format to describe certificates of attendance, examination results, degrees and diplomas, diploma supplements, professional certifications, employer recommendations and any other kind of claims that are related to learning.

## Alignment with Other Standards
The EDCI Data Model is an extension of the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model) expressed as XML/XSD, for the purposes of providing a standardised format of describing learning within the European Union and European Economic Area.

The Data model is also aligned with the [ELMO/EMREX Standard](https://github.com/emrex-eu/elmo-schemas)

## Contents
* The current version of the data model provides description of concepts including:
** definition of the Europass extension of a W3C Verifiable Credential
** definition of the Europass extension of a W3C Verifiable Presentation
** definition of a Europass learning opportunity
** definition of accreditation concepts

The namespaces and URIs provided in the model xsd files are currently placeholders, and will change on final release.

The data model will be put into production as part of the Europass portal in Q1 2020.
